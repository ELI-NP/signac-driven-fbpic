### Guideline for Code Contributions

* Use the [OneFlow](https://www.endoflineblog.com/oneflow-a-git-branching-model-and-workflow) model of development:
  - Both new features and bug fixes should be developed in branches based on `master`.
  - Hotfixes (critical bugs that need to be released *fast*) should be developed in a branch based on the latest tagged release.
